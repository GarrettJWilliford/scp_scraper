# scp_scraper
while the description and classification webdriver is only scraping scp 100 - 3999, the nickname scraper webscrapes all SCPs,
although this can be changed in the code

scp.scp(scp.driver_init())           >>| A ui of sorts, which allows you to pic a specific scp
scp.scp_nickname(scp.driver_init())  >>| Scrapes all nickname/scp_num data
scp.scp_scraper(scp.driver_init())   >>| Scrapes all scp_num/object_class/description data
